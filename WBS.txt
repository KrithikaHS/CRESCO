Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment (Prep Work)

Activities:

Set up project repository: ascensio/

Create separate backend/ and frontend/ folders

Create virtual environment for backend (venv)

Install base packages:

FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP, matplotlib

Initialize frontend with React (CRA or Vite)

Setup .gitignore, README, basic folder structure

Deliverable: Clean folder structure, virtual environments ready

Phase 1: Database & Models

Goal: Define all data entities and their relationships

Activities:

Decide on database (SQLite for MVP)

Define SQLAlchemy models:

UserProfile → skills, education, projects, interests

CareerPrediction → predicted career, probability, reasoning

MarketData → job trends, salary, growth (static CSV or JSON for MVP)

Define Pydantic schemas for API input/output

Setup database connection (database.py) and create tables

Deliverable: Database ready with models & tables

Phase 2: Backend API – Profile Management

Goal: Accept and store user profile data

Activities:

Create profile.py routes:

POST /profile → submit user profile

GET /profile/{id} → fetch profile

Validate input via Pydantic schemas

Store profile in DB

Return confirmation + profile ID

Deliverable: Fully working profile API

Phase 3: Market Intelligence Engine

Goal: Prepare market data for career fit calculation

Activities:

Collect sample datasets:

Job trends, salary ranges, skill demand (from Kaggle or mocked CSV)

Create market.py routes:

GET /market/{career} → return market-fit, growth, stability scores

Preprocess data: normalize values 0–100

(Optional) Implement simple caching for fast queries

Deliverable: Market intelligence API returning scores

Phase 4: Career Fit Prediction (ML Core)

Goal: Predict career suitability based on profile + market data

Activities:

Create prediction.py service:

Encode skills, projects, education into feature vector

Merge with market scores

Train ML model (Random Forest for MVP) on sample data

Create career.py routes:

POST /career-fit → returns top N career paths + probability

Integrate with DB → save predictions for future reference

Deliverable: Career fit prediction endpoint

Phase 5: Explainable Reasoning

Goal: Provide reasoning for predictions

Activities:

Simple Rule-based reasoning for MVP:

Example: If SQL + Python + backend projects → Data Engineer

Optional: SHAP for model feature importance

API endpoint:

GET /career-explanation/{profile_id} → returns human-readable reasoning

Integrate reasoning into career fit response

Deliverable: Explainable reasoning for each predicted career

Phase 6: Career Path Simulator

Goal: Show future trajectory for career paths

Activities:

Simple simulation formula:

salary_next_year = current_salary * (1 + market_growth * skill_factor)


Calculate projections for 1, 3, 5 years

Suggest skill roadmap for highest projected growth

API endpoint: GET /career-simulation/{profile_id} → returns salary + skill plan

Optional: Use matplotlib or Plotly for graph generation (serve as image/JSON)

Deliverable: Career simulation API

Phase 7: Frontend Development (React)

Goal: Provide UI for profile input and results display

Activities:

Create ProfileForm → collects skills, education, projects, interests

Create CareerCard → shows career path, probability, reasoning

Create Simulator → graph projections + recommended skills

Integrate Axios API calls to backend endpoints

Basic styling (MUI/Tailwind/Custom CSS)

Deliverable: Working React frontend with interactive dashboard

Phase 8: Integration & Testing

Goal: Ensure all modules work together

Activities:

Test backend APIs with Postman

Test ML predictions with multiple mock profiles

Connect frontend → make sure Axios calls fetch data properly

Add error handling (missing fields, invalid input)

Unit tests for backend + optional frontend tests

Deliverable: End-to-end working MVP

Phase 9: Enhancement & Optional Features

Optional/Advanced:

LLM-based explanations using GPT → more natural reasoning

Real-time market data scraping

User authentication + profile history

Export PDF report of career roadmap

Add more careers & detailed skill mapping
